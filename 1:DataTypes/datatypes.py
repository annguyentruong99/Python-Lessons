Data type and operators
There are a a couple main data types in Python:
1. Text type: str
2. Numeric type: int, float
3. Sequence type: list, tuple, range
4. Mapping type: dict
5. Boolean type: True, False
"""

# 1: text type
# Anything that goes in to this "" or '' is a string
# E.g:

"Hello Trang Beo"
"3"
"4"
"Du ma"
# You can use the print() fundtion to display the string in the console
# String is a immutable data, meaning you cannot change its content once it's being declared
# You can concadinate, meaning you can add two or more strings together using the + operator
# E.g:
print("An is " + "awesome :D")
# This prints: An is awesome. 

# 2: Numeric type
# Integer or decimal (float) numbers 
# E.g (int):
3
2
6
146862493
8758146
1
-1545
-7
#E.g (float):
1.45
2.6567

You can use math operators for calculations in Python
Some basic operators:
1. Addition: +
2. Subtraction: -
3. Multiplication: *
4. Division: /
5. Exponential: **

There are also some special operators:
1. Remainder: % 
This operator returns the remainder of a division (eg: 4 % 3 = 1)
2. Assignment operator: =
This operator is use to declare a variable (eg: x = 3)
3. Comparision operators: 
  a, == : This is to check if two data is equal, if they do return True, else returns False
  b, > : This is to check if a data is bigger
  c, < : This is to check if a data is smaller
  d, >= : This is to check if a data is bigger or equal
  e, <= : This is to check if a data is smaller or equal
  f, != : TThis is to check if two data is not equal, if they do return True, else returns False
