# In some program, we need the user to enter the data so we can work with it
# That is when the input() function is use
# E.g:
customterName = input("Please enter your name: ")

# By default, the input() function is going to accept the data as a string
# But we can change the type of data being inputed by putting input() into int() or float() function
# E.g:
customerAge = int(input("How old are you: "))
customerWeight = float(input("What is your weight: "))
